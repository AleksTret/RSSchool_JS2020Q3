                        <p>
                            Currently we have 121 dogs and 342 cats on our hands 
                            and statistics show that only 20% of them will find 
                            a family. The others will continue to live with us 
                            and will be waiting for a lucky chance to become 
                            dearly loved.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We feed our wards with the best food and make sure 
                            that they do not get sick, feel comfortable (including 
                            psychologically) and well. We are supported by 87 
                            volunteers and 28 employees of various skill levels. 
                            About 12% of the animals are taken by the shelter staff. 
                            Taking care of the animals, they become attached to 
                            the pets and would hardly ever leave them alone.
